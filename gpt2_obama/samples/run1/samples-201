 those in the United States.  And we're going to work so hard every day to rebuild bridges and restore order.  And that includes, among other things, helping local communities rebuild.  And as President, I will continue to partner with state and local leaders, from coast to coast, to get America to the places we need to find people -- places of opportunity, places where people can just stay where they are, wherever they are.

America needs more.

It's not new -- it's not new.  And my administration has worked hard to make college and high-quality jobs a priority as we move to a global, low-carbon economy.  Some jobs are here, others are nowhere.  And I believe that we can, and should, invest in jobs that are here.  Our students aren't competing in the global marketplace.  They're getting jobs.  And this year, we're investing $1 billion in a small business incubator that will grow from 5,000 employees into the next 100,000.  Some other investments will give those who need jobs a chance, and create up to 700,000 small businesses each year.  And we'll give small businesses and businesses and entrepreneurs the confidence and the resources to reach their full potential.

We know that the American people don’t like the prospect of jobs lost.  We like the possibilities -- and in some cases the certainty -- of the future.  We know that it is easier to blame our problems on the past -- we may not get the chance to do our part to help young people get the skills that they need to lead careers in industries that they love, or the future that they dream of creating and producing.  But we have to be clear:
  I am not here to blame Americans for their problems.   And we are here because of somebody else's concerns about the future; we are here because the future is here.  We are here because the challenges are here and we face those challenges in a way the last century didn’t, because the challenge of global isolation and destruction only grew larger and larger as we got older and we took more risks.

And the point is we can’t afford to go back to the way we were back then.  We can't afford to go back to the time of George Washington.  America just isn't ready for that kind of isolation, or the fear and uncertainty that comes along with a set of decisions.  We only get two things in terms of our capacity to confront the challenges that we face today:  a stronger economy and a stronger free market; and a more flexible international system. 

That doesn’t look like all that long a shot, or what we can find out in the long run.  In fact, that was the point I made many years ago, and I said this is our time to go back to pre-war terms and the system that produced the worst postwar depression.  We could have been living that era without those two things -- a strong central banking system and the creation of the financial sector and the banking super-wealthy, and a very tough-on-crime and tough-economy system that is a threat to our country and is a threat to the individual security of the American people, a threat to our freedom of enterprise and our personal liberty, and a threat to our national security to which every American is not subject. 

But that's not what our founders believed.  Our Founders believed in the centrality of the government to the power of the people and the people's rights and the rights of individuals and states.  That's what they believed.  That's why we're here today, and so many of your neighbors and friends and neighbors in the United States, in this hall, here -- because we believe that we can solve the world’s problems together -- because we believe that together, we can solve those problems together. 

That's why we’re here today to reflect on the role that government, and not the private sector, can play in this century not just as a means of building a more perfect union between rich and poor, but as a means of creating a more perfect union between a free and just economy.

That is not merely a case of one person’s livelihood being taken away from one individual.  This is a case where prosperity and security of one individual are threatened or diminished by the economic turmoil and loss of another.  It is a case where people are denied opportunities to develop their own talents and their own talents because of corruption or because of a belief in an ancient notion of a sacred cow or a corruption that has to be eradicated.  For centuries, those things that we’ve known and heard and heard -- and had seen before -- have caused such a profound distortion of our national character that we must always defend a vision of a kind of global peace that will make progress possible and that offers a future
