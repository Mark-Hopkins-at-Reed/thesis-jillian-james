 and I will continue to do so.  We need to make sure that we’re investing in education, not in bureaucracy.  When we do our job, we should be proud of it, but the education we receive doesn’t automatically bring us into the 21st century.  We are still at the beginning of a process that should get us there.

Now the truth is, when it comes to the economy, we need a new model to sustain the promise of opportunity for many of these young people, so long as it pays off for me and my administration as it should.  But the economic model must now lead to real change -- change that doesn’t just mean giving parents more control and more flexibility; real competition, competition that doesn’t just mean a smarter workforce, competition that doesn’t just mean hiring more people. 

That’s why, last month, I sent a budget to Congress to spur job creation.  It was a significant improvement, but one that kept on making sure that my administration didn’t become another Washington D.C. The result was a $177 billion in spending plan -- a plan that made sure that those on welfare had more money than people on welfare.  It also kept on improving the investments in Medicare and Medicaid that we need to help workers have.  It added billions to the budget for college, by the way -- it did so in the form of more money for everybody.  But when I looked at what that meant, I said, "Well, look at what we have to do to get that money back." 

We have to make sure that families don’t have to make those kinds of adjustments.  When I look at these specific cuts, the difference between what we said we would make and what Congress gave us in the December report is that in order to be competitive with the rest of the world, we now have to have the ability to raise revenues without making the usual deductions. 

For example, what we are getting is an annual defense budget that is just a dime less today than when we started.  That will bring our deficits down from roughly $600 billion over 1023 to roughly $600 billion.  And for those of you who are wondering how that happened, let me repeat this:  The next president should not take $600 billion out of our annual defense budget.  That's not who got it. 

Finally, in order to give middle-class families the security that they need, and give people of all income and wealth the chance to stay in their homes over time, a larger tax cut for small businesses and middle-class families is being pushed through.

That’s right.  That’s right.  And I’m directing my Treasury Secretary to make it clear they will not -- will not be able to take it all of -- in a future budget make sure that we’re not giving the wealthiest Americans tax breaks that, by their own calculation, will give them a huge tax advantage over everyone else by making the middle class pay a higher rate on their income.

That’s right.  What a joke.  That’s right.  These tax cuts will hurt the middle class, and hurt small businesses and small businesses hard, and hurt Americans in every major industry who depend on their income every single day of the week. 

Now, the biggest issue we’re going to have to fix is to make sure that people like me can still get ahead.  So I’ve ordered my economic adviser, Fred Hiatt, to go get a big backlog of proposals so that we can just give people the information they need.  So now are going to have to sign up 100 or more in categories like education, health care, transportation.  Because then folks around the country might have more information on what everybody else is doing.  Now, you get the idea. 

In addition, I’ve also directed my budget director, Dave Camp -- you can ask Dave Camp if you need any help when it comes to the Affordable Care Act.  So if you ever hear the question about when it comes to health care, and he’s here with you once, I’m glad you asked it.  And that’s true.  And there will definitely be some folks who are still looking for the solution to health care.  And with my own money, I want all the small businesses to get their fair shake and deserve a larger share of the tax money they're already sitting on.

I want the middle class to have the same chance to grow and develop.  So I’ve also ordered my economic advisor, Gary Cohn, to go up the ante in areas where there’s been a lot of focus on our recovery.  This includes the auto bailout and the stock market -- areas where there’s been a lot
