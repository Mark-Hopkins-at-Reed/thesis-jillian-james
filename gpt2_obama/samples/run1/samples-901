 to think about what the best way to protect our democracy is to get rid of this old policy."

Now, in the last few weeks, the debate around gun safety has been heated. Some have suggested that this is an attempt to restrict and muzzle our voices, or that the voices of responsible gun owners are somehow an expression of the state. And I would point out that's not exactly the truth.

When I am briefed, I will immediately provide the facts. I will not tolerate innuendities or unvarnished advice. All statements must be carefully evaluated, and those with conflicting information are immediately questioned. And I have made it clear, as President, I will not tolerate such innuendities or unvarnished advice.

On Tuesday, I spoke with many of you at NRA conferences. What I have said is that it is not possible for the vast majority of Americans to have an interest in preventing a child from owning a gun, or a grandfather from breaking the law and buying a gun. So I want to make clear that the government has to have a legitimate interest in protecting innocent citizens from gun violence. And the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms.

This is a matter of public safety. But I do believe that we have to have some trust between the rights and responsibilities of both gun owners and people who use those arms. And that can only be a discussion that can advance both our safety and our security, or our values. So I'm very concerned about the fact that we have a growing epidemic of gun violence across America. And that, I think, is largely responsible for it.

But we have to guard against it getting worse, particularly as we enter the fourth year of a comprehensive reform that has already saved more than 5 million lives. And I want to be absolutely clear about this: the American people have legitimate concerns about expanding the right of gun ownership for a child under 14 years old. But most importantly, we have widespread support for reform that will make it harder for anyone with a gun to violence. And we have to make sure that the Second Amendment is upheld. And we will never be there, as a country.







To Prime Minister Netanyahu and the leaders of the EU and USA, I thank you, along with our NATO allies, for your extraordinary leadership. I want to make clear to you that we stand with you, and that we will take every measure to make sure that the European Union works with you in building better relationships with Israel and Europe.

To your leaders and senior EU and USA officials, thank you for your extraordinary leadership. We have not put out a single NATO combat mission since 2000. That's part of what makes NATO special. And that includes the people who sent us there in the first place: Jews.

We have more than seven million members of the Dutch people -- people of roughly the same religious and ethnic diversity as us -- and we have a proud tradition of friendship between our governments. You and I shared a room at NATO headquarters over dinner last year. I told Prime Minister Netanyahu I was proud to go to Brussels because it was beautiful. He was very nice. But that was before I arrived here. And I don't think I didn’t know him very well, who I came to know as a young man. He’d be the leader of that room, one of the few rooms in the EU. And so he and I did a lot of talking -- and talked a lot of fraternizing. And it was clear that those two cultures, which were closer than some people think, and more advanced nations, were bound by very specific rules and regulations, and they had some common responsibilities.

This is not a rivalry we should be interested in -- it’s a destiny we should aspire to for our kids. And that's why I urge all of you to join our alliance.

Together, we’re going to keep these nations focused on the task at hand, and on the future of their citizens. And as we welcome new members of NATO, the days where we are joined by lesser allies is over. We will continue to have our best members, our partners, serving their country. We're going to keep you guys safe. We're going to keep you together. Every single member of our alliance should know that we will stay true to the ideals of our founding.

Together, we’re going to continue developing your defense technologies -- that’s why I’ve already mentioned these -- and bringing our ships and our planes and our missiles here. If you upgrade your plane or you upgrade your lighting -- because we're talking about American industry -- you can do it at your own risk -- because we want to keep American manufacturing and American exports here as high as our markets.

So when I talk about working together -- I want to start with the people who I want to thank for the great work that you are doing: Michelle and I are from
