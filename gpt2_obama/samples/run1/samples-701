.  And I want to thank them for everything that they've done.  I thank them for giving us hope and for giving us the space to take action as people of hope -- of goodwill.

I want to thank a lot of people.  To my family, friends, and fellow citizens who have supported our visit here; our great Mayor, Domenic Monge.  To all the men and women who have worn the uniform of your country, who love your country so much and so much more, including my outstanding Secretary of the Army, General Stan McChrystal, and so many great veterans.

You know, in your lifetime, there's always someone who has done so much for our country, someone who has inspired so many, someone who has inspired the world.  You do something together -- you do something to show the world that you stand with us, that you are with us.  That you respect the will of your Founding Fathers and the values of your Constitution.  That you respect the writ of the United States Congress.  That you represent the ideals in your country's founding.  That you believe in the American spirit and the idea that people should not be divided by race, but rather by religion, gender, and national origin, and that our purpose is shared and our hopes are called to a new day.

That's what Martin Luther King, Jr. called an "emergency call to action."  One hundred and twenty-first days later, we are still at that emergency call.  We're still at that call.  We were here six months ago.

In light of the violent attacks that took place today, we are calling for all of us to join with Americans everywhere in holding President Obama to a higher standard of engagement and achievement -- by standing up and standing up for the right of our citizens to determine their own destiny.  And our task is simple:  to build new partnerships, not just to whip up more division; to remind the world that America is strong and that we’re diverse, and that our ideals come from within, not beyond.

We understand that the world only needs an increasingly diverse and inclusive America.  There was the time when black Americans could barely vote; when young African Americans couldn't afford college; when gay adults could barely afford a seat on the bus, or sit on the assembly line....  We recognize that the United States can change for the better, but it must never accept a status quo driven by fear and division.  It must recognize, as we already know, that the greatest threats to our security -- and our ability to recover -- come not from outside, but from within; that the dangers of an aging, less responsive old failing, and the ways in which the challenges of a new and growing world threaten our country.

What we also know is that we cannot keep doing what’s not right, even as we reaffirm the values upon which the founding of this nation was founded.

That's the lesson of a past war of which I will never forget.  The British thought they might take heart today.  The Germans in their own words.  "We can do nothing against the will of men like the United States." They were right. The future of these nations begins with us standing up for ourselves and defending our own future.

Of course, as we’ve made clear throughout this week’s election, some in this country and around the world believe they will be unable to do that. Our message is simple and clear:  Let there be no place for fear and division.  Let there be no division in our common future.

On October 21st, an election can happen again. If we are willing to show the world that we are united in common purpose, when we come together in common purpose this February, we’ve earned our place among a dying civilization. We are at a crossroads of competing forces -- one in which a resurgent Russia seeks to impose its will on an emerging America, and the other one, in which we seek freedom and justice for all human beings, whether they are Black or white or Indian or Kurd or Muslim, Christian or Jew.

For far too long, too long, both the United States and Russia have been unable to solve these challenges.  We must unite around a common goal:  to build the capacity, cooperation, and vision to build the future that the people of Europe, and the world, deserve.  Now is the time to rejoin the world in the same sense that Russia and the United States were joined a quarter century ago.

Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless the United States of America.






Thank you, Joe.   Thank you.  Well, thank you.  To you and Mrs. Biden, thank you very much.   

I want to thank your wife and your daughters for your service to this country.
