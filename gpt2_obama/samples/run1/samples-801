======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 your children is, in fact, a matter of life and death choices. And even as the Affordable Care Act is changing the way American health care is sold, it’s also changing the way that children receive their health insurance. So tonight, I am announcing that all children under 13 will receive the same kind of coverage that you get right here in Colorado.

This means that if your insurance company cancels your policy, your child won’s health insurance, and if it turns out she was really lucky, her health insurance will no longer go down for 13 months. So tonight, I am announcing that insurance companies beginning this holiday season will finally offer affordable, portable health insurance to their employees.

And this means that after having just five months to plan and prepare before your insurance company finally changes your coverage, you've already gotten your insurance.  Because of the Affordable Care Act on Tuesday, folks who sign up for health insurance this year will receive a new check that details the amount of coverage that they will get, and what kinds of benefits that will mean for you in the fall. And these benefits will be provided at no cost to you or to your employer.

Now, here’s the truth: You don’t have to be a billionaire to keep your dream of having health care covered and affordable.  Even though it costs more than most Americans pay, you do not have to be a celebrity for it.  If you work hard and are willing to work hard, you can get a good deal, regardless of the cause, at a very affordable rate.  In fact, many have argued that health care costs should go up at the rate of inflation because the quality of our health care is now in free fall.  If you agree with that theory, you should at least have a basic understanding of the theory -- because otherwise, we could all be living in a very different planet.

Now, all of this is happening because of laws passed by Congress and signed by President Bush.  These are laws that protect our children from being harmed or neglected for reasons that are beyond our control.  And they are working.  Many parents who are out there today can't wait to hear their kids’ voices.  Even parents who have never been in a job -- or a campaign, or a business, or just about anything -- actually are more likely to get laid, to save money, and to get sick.  We talked to more than a few employees.  A lot of the women who carry their kids through these tough times, they want to give them the same opportunity that I’ve got.  We talked to a few health care experts.  And they agree that we have to keep fighting to make insurance affordable.  And what they want is certainty for their children.  They want it for the same reason that they want every single child to have access to quality, affordable care.

Now, these are the facts.  Because of these laws, more and more kids across the country are getting good coverage.  Now, it doesn’t take long before millions more are getting hurt the minute these laws take effect.  And for good measure, today my administration is proposing the following reforms to fight the epidemic of child care fraud in Medicare.

First, millions of claims will be reviewed, and reforms that keep costs down will put Americans’ health and finances at risk.

Second, we will strengthen the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so that children who are healthy, willing, and in good need can receive a quality, affordable plan from a company that can help get them insured.

Third, we will work with states like Colorado, Oregon, and Washington to crack down on financial institutions that are abusive and out of reach.  These aren’t simply bad lenders.  They’re credit card lenders.

Now, let me be clear.  These reforms won’t solve everything, but they are steps in the right direction.  We are taking some steps.

The first step is to make sure that these laws do not apply to nearly 100,000 small businesses and credit card lenders across the country who continue to engage in deceptive practices on their customers' behalf.  So we’re looking at different reforms that will be broad-based -- because consumers can't always afford specific plans.

In California, we’re going to take steps to improve our consumer reporting process to take more seriously abusive practices out of the industry.  And we’re going to do this by requiring credit card issuers to report suspected abuse on their websites or in person.

Finally, we’ll help encourage responsible lending and capital investments by reducing the use of risky financial instruments, using our Recovery Act to expand consumer lending at credit unions and other financial institutions.  And we’ll call on all those who practice what they preach -- honest broker-dealers to join us.

We know that with tougher consumer
