 outreach of America, we’ll keep those jobs here at home.  There will be fewer empty promises.  More competition.  Less demand by small business to open and keep doors open.  Not as high an stakes, but not as high as if you did it today.

The question is, is it fair to continue a trend that makes no sense?  Is it fair to continue a trend that makes no sense because we're trying to protect the very American middle class that we depend on?  And that brings me to the other issue that I’m going to address in a few minutes, two words I think are most important:  war.

War is the worst form of war.  And I’ve made it clear that we have to stop our wars when they come, even as we keep doing what we believe is right and do whatever is necessary to keep our armed forces strong and our nation strong.  And if we refuse to act without thinking, with self-confidence and with a deep sense of patriotism -- whether it’s because we don’t have enough troops, whether it’s because there have been too many wars -- then I am not going to be the Commander-in-Chief that I am today.  My message to the American people is clear:  Do not go into Iraq and Afghanistan knowing we will not succeed.  Our troops will not be our allies.  Their country is gone.  We will pursue objectives that are outside the reach of any party.  And I believe that in the time that I have, and the time that I have as President, you can be what America is, and we will pursue your values.

That's my message to the men and women in uniform who’ve served with honor; to the families and friends of servicemembers who’ve served their country with distinction; to our friends and allies who’ve made great sacrifices for our cause -- and to all who are still fighting at the moment, to the families who have loved ones who are just gone, or are just starting to rebuild their lives?  You are there, America is here, and I want to be there for them; I want to be there for the country they love.  That’s what we owe to you.  And you don’t have a country where you do that.

So, I think it’s fair to say that our national leadership may have got a little bit less rosy in recent years, but in recent years, we have actually done a lot better.  Look at our economy, the auto industry -- Chrysler, General Motors, that’s how we’ve kept the lights on, that’s how we’ve kept the lights on.  Those big automakers don’t know there’s a bright future ahead of them, and they’ve got to start seeing what the American auto industry wants.  

But for those manufacturers, going into the new decade, they’ve got a real problem because the biggest one percent of the company is down by more than 300,000.  Many of the top executives aren’t as high-ranking, or as senior, so they’ve got to make a hard choice. 

My friend, General Motors, made a good point about that in his speech.  He said they spend more every month than I did.  They spend more every day than most families in America have spent on their own.  They're not getting a little bit more because they invest more, they’re contributing to the economy that’s already benefited them.  They make more money when they invest, but they make only a little bit less when they pay less taxes.  So why on Earth would a company be concerned about losing a little bit of revenue? Why would they be concerned about losing a little bit of revenue?  Why would General Motors be?  Why would they be troubled if they lost their business? 

So we are going to put ourselves on the path to competitiveness, even if our competitive position continues to decline.  We’ve got to make sure we understand and compete to the fullest; to the best of our ability; so that we’re competing effectively against these other players like GM makes money on all those fancy plug-in cars, they make more money than us.

But we also have to look at the broader picture.  Every single family in America who’s got a business that’s putting a family’s livelihood at risk.  Every single household that’s losing a job or a loved one’s life because they’re on the losing end of an auto accident.  Every single single individual on the planet who’s lost their job because their employer’s policies are hurting the American economy.  We know that --
