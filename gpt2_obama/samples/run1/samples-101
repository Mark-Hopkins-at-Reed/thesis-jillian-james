 to keep their economy strong.  It depends on the hard work of hard workers, and on government.  It depends on businesses not running down factories, or selling off their assets.  And most of all, if we are serious about making sure America's workers have a growing middle class -- as hard as I believe we are -- then we have to make sure that this government is actually working for workers, not just corporations.

Now, I don't know if it's true that the deficit hasn't grown at a rate that most of us expect.  And I'm going to have to explain to this audience the reason for this deficit -- it's a deficit in terms of our defense spending over the last century, and that includes, in part, the cost of every American family.  And that doesn't mean that each American's economic future is assured.  But we're a strong nation when we say we're going to make sacrifices and pay off the debt.  And the reason we're a successful nation is not because of the strength of our economy, but because of the power of it.

I think that the American people are really getting a sense from this debate that I'm not saying we're a terrible country in terms of our deficit, but we're a great nation when we say we're going to solve it, because you're doing a lot better than we are.  And we're going to help our kids get in the most education in the world, and we're going to make sure that they have the opportunity to get a good job.

But the thing that I do know -- and I'm starting to think -- is that this debate is moving in a particular direction.  There's a lot of Republicans who are very concerned that if we don't get the debt fixed, that we can't make it right.  They are a pretty heavy favorite to see us go the right way, but they are tired of waiting and they're tired of waiting as long.  And they'll put it out with the teeth as long as they can, as long as we do all have a plan.  So we'll be able to make things right.  Right now, we're just going to have to do something.

And this debate reminds me of a moment that I have come across in terms of debates over entitlement programs.  This debate in this forum has been about the nature of entitlements.  It's about whether -- and as far as I can tell, I didn't get into it before in this debate.

At the moment, we're looking at a lot of programs like Medicare and Social Security and they're very different.  And they're very different because they offer fewer people health care.  And those programs aren't very popular like I think they are.  They're not quite as popular as programs like Medicare, and Social Security, and Medicaid, in that sense -- they aren't popular at all -- they're not necessarily going nationally as part of the same package of packages.

But as long as they're popular, they will keep getting added as more and more people sign up.  They're going to be added because they want to make sure that the federal government is actually making good quality investments in our people.  And this debate is not about whether you need Medicare or Social Security, it's not about whether we need to make more big investments in our health care system as that's part of the package that's offered by the federal government.  It's not about whether we will make more cuts in Social Security or Medicare.  It's not about whether we will make more cuts in Medicare.

This debate has the potential to be kind of silly or, in some cases, even kind of silly in the abstract -- it could be something as ridiculous as giving in to a question like, "What, if anything, would we do as a nation to ensure that more of our kids get health care if we don't keep our costs down?"  But as the debates here go -- as I have seen before this debate gets a little less real and more abstract, the debate gets a little less serious.

And this debate has a chance to be a real debate.  There are some -- there are some -- some of the people in this audience that were very nice and some of the folks here that aren't nice.  There are some folks that are really nice, some of the folks here here that aren't nice and we won't be able to do our job and we've got a lot of people here here saying how we can give back to our kids and give them better choices with health care.  That was interesting.

Good afternoon everybody.  Welcome to the debate, the debate of the future of our economy.  And now, I want to thank Governor Romney, of Massachusetts for coming on stage tonight.  I've done a lot to try to keep some sort of sense of perspective going into this debate, but I think it's a
