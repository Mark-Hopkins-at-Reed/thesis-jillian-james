 each country, we're going to try to make sure -- we're going to try to get that done here.

I've said before I believe that if people from each of these countries -- if we want an open, fair and honest exchange, we have to allow our people to have the same rights and opportunities that we have. I can't argue with that. There are differences as much as differences. There's a difference in the Constitution. There's a difference in law. There's a difference in understanding -- and the differences, they've been there for decades. 

So we're going to work through these issues in the spirit, and the spirit of the United States of America -- and to make sure that we do our part as a country, that when you ask somebody whether she or he agrees with the issues in the Affordable Care Act, I say it's because she or he agrees with it. If you ask her what she believes is in the Affordable Care Act, she says -- if she agrees with it, then I say it's because she or he agrees with it.

Our country has been blessed with an incredible civil debate right from the founding to the most recent Civil Rights Act. And over the last four years, I've watched, and listened to, and looked over the shoulder of a nation of immigrants from different countries about how we, as a nation, can continue to move forward without a single bill passing over the last two years. And that's the good news -- that every bill we pass in Congress contains strong support from people from both parties in the United States.

I've watched those debates unfold tonight. I'm proud to be a part of them. I'm proud to serve as an architect of a system that works; that works best. And I'm proud to be a part of that debate here tonight -- and if we don't act -- if we don't act quickly, and aggressively, and responsibly, I know that we won't be able to move forward at a quick enough pace that we can move forward.

This will be a momentous day for the American people. This was a very long story -- not just a good day in a country, but a great one. And I'm proud of the people who have done the hard work behind my back.

Now, to every person who came to Congress this year who’s come to see me, to hear you tell your stories, because I'm proud to tell them that you came here as a U.S. citizen or citizen of some other country, that's what we’ve always been about, and that’s been your opportunity, to be a part of a larger story in your country.

And that’s why you’re here -- because you've got to remember, it’s been America’s greatest success story. And that was not just because it’s the story of your lives; it was because we are. And that’s why this nation is your story. That’s what your stories are about. That’s why we're here now -- as a nation, as Americans. That’s why we're proud of you. That’s why we’re here. 

Thank you very much, everybody. May God bless all who we love. May God bless the United States of America.







Thank you, Hawaii, for being a host.

Well, I want to start with a note here. I want to thank everyone involved in this effort for their outstanding work. Every one of you -- my friends -- has spoken out. And I want to mention to my outstanding Secretary of State, John Kerry, who has made it clear how deeply that he’s concerned. I want to thank all the people who worked to make sure that the Affordable Care Act continues to attract and retain as many healthy, middle-class, law-abiding citizens as possible -- from our universities to our health care system to our rural communities; from our small businesses to the big cities and the middle classes living here on this island, our families are living closer to us, and that we’re getting better health and better care not just for our citizens, but for our entire nation. 

We’re also taking steps forward that will create the jobs and a more prosperous future for Hawaii and all the people of Hawaii who’ve lived in Hawaii for generations. 

I want to thank Senator John McCain for his efforts, his leadership, and his cooperation in preparing both parties to move forward on these important issues. 

But my first priority at this time is making sure those reforms make it better for everyone -- and it’s going to take time.  These are very serious issues, and I believe that -- and that there are going to be a lot of discussions about how do we go forward in the next few days and, therefore,
