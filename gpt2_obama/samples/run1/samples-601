 ideology that you have championed, and a country that's come through you.

So let me say this, young people: I have a message for you. I want you to listen. I want you to think about a day or more ago just this morning, I spoke about the importance of a clean energy economy to the United States of America. We were in a global recession and we took a terrible hit to our economy. We had one of the worst business cycles of any nation in history, and we had our worst week ever.

I knew then what I know now -- we needed a strong, growing economy that generated new revenues. We needed one that made tough cuts necessary, and one that protected millions of hardworking Americans from the effects of a housing bubble and a food crisis. We needed a strong, growing economy that was producing jobs and creating American jobs.

We were in a global recession and we took a terrible hit to our economy. We had one of the worst economic disasters of all time -- the worst housing bubble in history.

We just had to give a lot more tax dollars to banks to stimulate the economy. Because the recovery was strong, and our workers are still home to work, nobody is out there looking for work.

So it's no secret I'm against any and all bank bailouts. I know why the markets have moved backwards. I know why financial markets have ticked lower. I know why we have to make tough decisions about our assets and risk our jobs. And I can say that this recession was not a season of panic or despair. But it was no secret that Wall Street believed we were in a long and tough struggle, and we just had to make tough decisions. We had to make tough cuts in the same areas where we’re hurting. We had to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We had to restore our economic leadership. We had to make tough decisions like buying more health care to keep our seniors in check. So that's how our recovery began.

It was no secret we were in a long and tough struggle, and we just had to make tough decisions. We had to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. We had to restore our economic leadership. We had to make tough decisions about doing business or housing that led to more than 200,000 small business closings each year. What’s more, in these -- in the last decade, that number has plummeted to fewer than half the number that it was in the 1990s.

So there’s now an international crisis in our economy and my message to you is, do what it takes to get this economy growing again. Your representatives here today are right -- they need to focus on the big challenge at hand. And that’s why, last week, I told Congress, and the American people, that our top priority in the coming year is to get this economy growing again. That’s how you get this economy just about anywhere.

And in this tough economy, we're going to need leaders who don't throw up when this happens. It doesn’t mean we can stop chasing debt and busting our way out on a high-fiving couch. It doesn't solve our challenges, it doesn’t mean we’re in a position to build even. And we’re not going to stop there.

Now, that’s where our message will take us as Americans. That’s where we will stand as an economy -- on balance, that’s where we’ll be judged by the courage and vision that our workers showed. That’s where we will build and start changing and finding new markets across the country. That’s where we‘ll have a focus that will lead to new jobs, new businesses, new opportunity.

That’s exactly what we’ll need in the next eight years -- not just a quick recovery, not just a short one, but something even bigger and even more profound and even more lasting than this crisis now, and something we must seize now.

Thank you. Please God bless you. Your God bless the United States of America.









Thank you very much, John, everyone. Everybody, please have a seat.

We are blessed to have some very brave Americans who are here today, and we’ve got some very brave members of Congress here, all of whom are Democrats. So we owe a tribute to two of my close friends, and Congressman Nancy Pelosi -- who has a long track record of courageous policy positions -- the Chairman of the Democratic Study Committee, and the Ranking Member on the Republican Study Committee, and the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Thank you very much.

Thank you. Please have a seat.

Well, Mr. President, I wanted to join you at the State of the Union. Tonight I want to thank each member of
