year's end
the time it takes a contrail
to dissolve

deep in the woods
leaves drifting over
what used to be a wall 

autumn light
nobody I know
in the obits

autumn leaves
I follow
their drift

where the carpet
is wearing thin
autumn sunlight

as old as I feel
on a gray morning...
autumn equinox

evening calm
her garden the color
of moonlight

new coolness 
a cloud passes through
the mountain notch

awake
in the dark
the darkness

narrow path
I make way
for the butterfly

coming home...
the scent of the ocean
before the sound

Labor Day
a fly buzzing around
the leftovers

poor neighborhood
a dog barking at the end
of a rope

vacant lot
hardly worth
a haiku

steady rain
where the bookstore
used to be

class reunion
an old friend's glance
at my name tag 

Easter vigil
candle flames tremble
at our breath

just passing through...
a parking lot where I saw
Gone with the Wind

soft rain
fishing line parts
a cloud of gnats

train window
the landscape coming 
to a stop

almost spring
her pink scarf taken
by the wind

a furniture store
where the church used to be 
vernal equinox

midnight
the silence beyond
the streetlight

waving goodnight
after the party
the chill

the white coffin
she was buried in
this winter light

first snow
a walk through fallen leaves
to my childhood

harvest moon
the things I have left
undone

harvest moon
she tells him
she's late

downtown
pointing the way
with her cigarette

evening light
following the anchor line
into the sea

twelve years old
learning to pronounce
Hiroshima

an infant asleep
on her mother's lap...
this heat

the silence
around our words...
fireflies

winter moon
a tired old man
in the mirror

the laughter of children
running uphill . . 
Gettysburg

waiting up
for their teenaged daughter...
distant fireworks

evening rain
she lets down
her hair

at the end
of a long afternoon
my faded shadow

awakened
by moonlight
an old regret

only the wind
off the ocean
Omaha Beach

how quickly
the nights grow longer 
fireweed in bloom

a few petals
left by the sweeper...
sunset clouds

locked out
I write a haiku
about daffodils

under a sky
of no particular color
dandelions

another spring
who will tell the dandelion
it's a weed

powdering the dog
a child asks if fleas
go to heaven

Valentine's Day
shaking the snow
from the roses

a toast
to the departing year -
snow turns to rain

after a storm
the absence
of a tree

waiting room
the steady hum 
of the fish tank

in the nursing home
she talks about the brother
no one talks about

winter temptation
in the seed catalogues
perfect tomatoes

the evening train
almost empty 
sundogs

the morning sun
on grandma's grave
first butterfly

writer's block -
staring out the window
at snowflakes

Easter Sunday
the carefully trimmed beard
of the young priest

reading
the tea leaves... the gray
in her hair

the doctor wants
to take a closer look...
coffee gone cold

good news
from the cardiologist
autumn butterfly

dusting the books
I'll read when I have time
winter solstice

outside 
our bedroom window
falling sleet

dried leaves
hurry down the path
standard time

sleeping late
this autumn morning
the bed half empty

week of rain 
the henna tatoo
fading fast

crisp wind
the taste of the apple
just after picking it

on the beach
by the ancient city
sand castle ruins

rain
mixed with snow
spring equinox

Valentine's Day
we let the champagne
go flat

her head
bent over tea leaves...
how old she's grown

long winter
my wife slows her pace
to mine

undressing for bed
I find a hole in my sock -
the winter wind

returning spring
in the dawn light she looks like
my first love

morning prayer
the patter of rain
as I reach amen

teenagers
exchanging promises
summer's end

low tide 
a shorebird's call
rises from the mud

75 today
I walk through a puddle
because I can

her Alzheimer's
a dragonfly
goes... comes

last of his line
the year of his death
still uncarved

snow falling
on the headstones...
just and unjust wars 

petals in the wind
my neighbors practice tai-chi
in the parking lot

first firefly...
she asks me to repeat
what I just said

wrinkles in the bedsheet early dawn

first light...
after the car alarm
birdsong

second martini—
I like the way she asks me
if I twitter 

my first bite
of persimmon—
a trace of Shiki

Sunday drive 
all the rain clouds
toward home

Holy Week
she teaches her grandchild
to light a candle

another spring
I revise
my death poem

winter break
I hope I'll be home
for the crocuses

garden Buddha
morning rain washes away
the snow

the age
I used to call old...
winter solstice

quiet Sunday
a winter fly
too slow to kill

old photo
I recognize
my father's silence

hard times
the car salesman's
missing tooth

starry night
one firefly
after another

Assisi sunset
pilgrims gather
at a gift shop

summer salad 
a nasturtium burns
the tip of my tongue

city sunset
he buys her
a rose

red light
the bus driver reads
his horoscope

flag pin
in the salesman's lapel
Memorial Day

the soft patter
of a computer keyboard
midnight solitude

main street
a red pick-up cruises
the spring rain

traffic jam
a flight of geese
across the highway

first light
an unknown bird
sings me awake

spring equinox
opening our fortune cookies

darkened church
she teaches her grandchild
to light a candle

Ash Wednesday
this is the year
he'll quit

a spider web
caught in my hand
scent of rain

thin crescent...
I wonder what
she meant by that

packing up the creche
one of the wise men
is missing

cold moon
a carriage horse trots
up Sixth

cold moon
the glitter of city lights 
in the river

thin crescent
she closes
the curtains

whistling kettle
snowflakes
in the wind

cold rain
lavender neon surrounds
a sex shop window

twentyfourseven
an empty laundromat
at dawn

overtime...
through an office window
the harvest moon

a night of fireflies
and cricket song...
the end of summer

a damp evening 
each of us with
our own cloud of gnats

rain on the lake
turning down
the volume

where do I
put the accent 
Hiroshima

brookside
whales are roaring
in a poem I read

sudden shower
cursing the umbrella
he left at home

outside the wall
around the cemetery
long grass

mother's day
something sexy
for his wife

war news
I wash the ink
from my fingers

rainy night
a light in
the bookstore window

wiping his eyes 
before the lights come up-
sad movie

winter sunset
shadows of branches
climb the fire escape

wildfire haze
between the icebergs 
the blue wind

January walk
Santa Claus and a flag
in a neighbor's window

my friend's ashes
heavier than I expected
winter wind

home for a visit
the sound of rain
on the river

low mass
the old priest believes
more than he remembers

new year's party
the divorced couple
leaves together

undulation
of a faded flag
autumn afternoon

midwinter
the coffee drinker
sips tea

morning rush
reading Walden
on the subway

election day
revising the poem
one more time

fog moving in
another phone call
unreturned

dandelions 
I lose sight of
the yellow butterfly

summer rain
my umbrella
stays closed

early summer
old women in the shade
of the bus shelter

a boy and his dad
playing catch out back...
long shadows

main street-
ribbons that used to be
yellow

terminal... 
his favorite ice cream 
melts in the cup

spring morning
those young men have noticed 
what she's not wearing

old western 
black hats white hats 
in shades of gray

spring rain
a man standing outside
the bus shelter

snowflakes
a robin's flight
from tree to tree

serving coffee
she asks if I take cream
the curve of her wrist

someone whistling
Blue Moon at the falls 
the mist

waiting for you
at the sidewalk cafe
half moon

chemotherapy-
she always liked the way
I kissed her hair

undulation
of a faded flag-
autumn afternoon

streetlight
my shadow growing
fading

rainy day
they give me back
my shoelaces

storm clouds -
the roofer talks about
overtime

nearly eighty -
opening
a jar of preserves

long after
the funeral service
- the unspoken words

dusk-
an unfinished sweater
on the rocking chair

sleepless night -
the whistle of a distant train
going  where?

Minnesota cold
even motorcycles
hibernate

lenghtening days 
a bird's shadow crosses
the yellow wall

last straw rejection 
the telemarketer tells me
I'm too old

a gloomy sunday
I sip my wine
and watch the rain
once on such a day
it was the time for love

poetry meeting
I try to read my haiku...
a frog in my throat

here and there
breaking through the dusk's mist
bright lights

voices of loons
cross the misted cove
call and response

A red berry falls
Staining the snow 
A silent sunset.

This dark night
Only white spots move
On the calico cat.

spring thaw
water from the fridge drips
onto the floor

Post Office 
stamped on the sidewalk
pink blossoms

wooden Buddha
with a cracked head on display
no buyers

new moon 
lamplight fills the holes
in a shot-out sign

a new month - 
different seeds 
on the spaniel's ears 

ah these short nights
hardly time to see
seeds up

last day of the year
a leaf in the wind over a long
stem

a procession
the funeral of thirty one
December 2004

snowflake
without a word, the woman
gagged

the printer spits
Millennium phoenix
another sheet

blue iris
she watches the needle
penetrate his flesh

hibiscus
under the eaves
frost burned petals

the fish lazily surface
in the pond nearby 
the sun on my teacup

dream catcher
the shifting colours
of rain

moss growing
on the manhole cover 
winter rain

wild wind
on dry sedge
what more on her mind? 

oak stump-
i remember the hornets
last summer

apple core
how to bottle
memories

though touch-less
the intimate rustle of silk 

first dawn alone-
the widow eats his half
of the orange

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline

lunar eclipse-
his eyes on her frayed
jeans front 

petal gust-
the street flutist's
scrambled notes 

blue dawn?
the rain's last phrase
on a glass pane

red lobster-
her prying glance
through the mist

news of his death 
I can't stop looking
at the sickle moon

mixing bowls-
the shallow echoes
of bells 

winter solstice
the widow tightens
her braids

candle drippings
on the epitaph-
a broken word

granite wall
a cold touch so hard
to resist

mountain wind
the echo of a cuckoo's
cough louder

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline

plop
the sound of bubble
from a carp

pine strand
flailing in night sky-
the first low star

twilight rain
the blue heron mid-lake
somehow smaller

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline

daybreak -
ice between
the river stones

opaque windows 
barring the dawn 
of the new year

even seagulls 
imitate the stones 
first frost

the sound of foam
withdrawing from the shore
our unsaid goodbyes

winter trees
waiting on the silence
our breaths

full moon
he smoothens a wrinkle
on her hand

somehow
our shrinking shadows touch
harvest moon

words
we've left unsaid-
Indian summer

crocus buds
secrets we've kept
from each other

cherry blossoms
shedding in the moonlight
the Milky Way

winter sky
the white cat's eyes
bluer

locking it -
moonlight at the back
of the mailbox

the coming of summer-
all the petals
i brushed off my hair

gray spring dawn-
the shiver of daffodils
in my bones

this cold-
Sakura cherry blossoms
on my window

this sunless spring day
chickadees chatter on-
my indecisions

watching rain
drum beat on window pane
the deaf cat

spring fever
shoots among the lilies
she can't name

mirror-
she sees her flaws
in his eyes

mirror
her mother's lips
pursing like hers

between her
and his goodbye-
sudden hail

from haiku scribblings
to a prayer
on a giant wave

silence -
the evening snow falls
onto moss

secrets
burrowing in sand dunes
a pale sunlight

left out in the rain
her old haiku
on cherry blossoms

late winter walk-
soft rain on bare cherry trees
harder on my thoughts

in the mist
waiting to meet you-
budding crocus

frosted dawn-
his words hang
over coffee

deep winter
nothing much to say
even among crows

on street -
a shower of petals
for no one

first frost
the last of the roses
have lost their names

girl in Sunday dress
in her father's shadow
lost too soon

day after Christmas-
crows waddling to bus stop
no one awaits

distant thunder-
a caterpillar drops
from a ragged leaf

blizzard-
the slanting lines, piercing lines
our locked hands 

first frost
the chapel two hours darker
for vespers

white sun
burning through November sky
her nth unanswered call

turning
one leaf at a time-
entries for memorials 

autumn sunset
breaches rain-swept horizon-
as embers sizzle

picking autumn leaves
off the grass, her grave
nothing but fine rain

pomegranate seeds
bursting in their hands
613 haiku

on an evening trail
of red dragonflies swarming
in a pool, stars 

leaves crackling-
in her grave tiny hands sweep
leavings of sparrows 

swarm of tiny wings
fades out in the autumn sky-
unfinished journal 

first light
the perfect symmetry
of a moth

white moonlight
seeps into my sadness-
into a mulch bed

grey skies grey thoughts
so clear as reflections
on rain puddles

maple twig
turns lemon hue in the rain-
i reply to summer mail

folding beach mats
the whiff of fresh grilled corn
this chilly morning

dawn by the river-
we breach a wall of sand
the cry of a loon

crow browsing grass
steps on camellia blossom-
fractured silence

cloudy day
my thoughts stuck
on a spider web

concentration camp
winter branches touch
the statue's shoulders

stripping off
her sweatshirt 
sparks in the dark

valentine's day
only rain
on the scarecrow

noon 
the morning clouds
roll from the valley

aged painter 
trembling leaves
from the tip of his brush

tailgating trucker
is that load bound for K-Mart
worth more than my life?

This road
no one goes down it
autumn evening

Natural rhythms
moons and tides supplanted by
yellow red and green

Seven miles per gallon
Bush thanks you for 
supporting the Iraq war

My Ford Explorer
on a never-ending quest
for a parking spot

Cochrane Alberta 
Coyotes howling in the night 
Honking, geese at dawn 

Like Custer's bugler,
you sound the charge. Remember
the Little Big Horn.

I-5 corridor
Microsofties creep to work
slowly, in nice cars

If you really love
America hang that flag 
on a bicycle

invasive species
my barber points out
my first white hairs

slowly...
a loon preens
in the mountains reflection

Atlanta traffic
easy to see why Sherman
burned this city down

a hundred streets named
peachtree - no wonder sherman
burned this city down

I saw that finger!
yes you in the Intrepid -
we shall meet again

he's a stop and go
christopher columbus in
your ford explorer

brooklyn bridge walkway
bombsquad found a stray backpack 
homeland traffic jam

keep an eye open
for food, gas and ten-year-old - 
an amber alert!

the mailbox
captive in snowdrift
a letter from war

late afternoon –
a wind chime softly sings
in snowy garden

autumn bonfire –
all my summer dreams
scatter with the smoke

growing darkness
gleam of setting sun
on Chinese Lantern

waiting...
dandelion fluff
lands on the table

the winter sun 
in the cancer ward -
a quiet old couple

old pond -
another lily
in bloom

One just sits
And blue dawn light floods
his poor house.

Soprano, clear and cool,
and pale violin float
Above the freeway noise.

chemo patient
seeking inspiration
in a bookstore

November  
her nipple ring cools

pumpkin moon:
tai chi movements time
the eclipse photos

frost
on the pumpkin:
lunar eclipse

earthquake
with the typhoon  more coins
at the temple

Memorial Day 
a shadow for each
white cross

a twilight sun
between two peaks -
white lilacs

spring moonset 
a rice ball for
breakfast

in the grasses
crickets calling
the full moon

Eating alone 
The sound of cold milk
Into a glass.

in my rear view mirror
the moon
on full beam

hard frost
wrapping myself up against
the breakfast news

winter bleak
under the rail bridge
graffiti blooms

left padlocked
under streetlight
orion's bike 

past the pleiades the silent flight of many white birds

christmas lights...
high above the street a skein
of twilight geese

in the walled garden
the scent
of decaying apples

boardwalking
the dragonfly's shadow
drops through a crack

another day
another apple crumble
... autumn deepens 

Heavy the heads of darkened sunflowers, I wonder, how long do I have

autumn days
the weight of my life's
unpicked apples

hindsight
a field of
cut stalks

tree burl
summer reveals
my old scars

our shadows
leaning on the railings
on the pond

wind chime
my phone picks up
a wifi hotspot

fallen apples
the constellation of
the gardener

double espresso, the wail of sirens on a sultry night

i wait for the weather forecast, wiping sunflower pollen from the windowsill

water lilys
a leaping fish
catches the light

in the depths
of her sunglasses
blue sky  some
passing clouds

leaning over the fence our late neighbour's rose

solstice day
park grass pale
where the fairground
rides had been

two swans
the progress
of twilight
along the river

forget-me-nots
our white dog shakes off
pale blue stars 

remembering you
cold and warm
on the same breeze

day break
half a pale blue
egg shell 

good friday
the outstretched arms
of the espalier pear

how high into
the hillside cemetery
the fog tide rolls 

Holes in the cloud. A shade of blue I've never seen

flashing against
the winter killed grass
a swan's whiteness

Exposed roots.
The tree outside her
childhood home

Punctuation.
A rose petal falls
from the vase

One week later
fewer roses in
a slenderer vase

no bag we wrap the leeks in the obituary page

all the suns
that we can muster
winter celandine

unsuspected metastasis moss on the roof tiles

hard frost all the new benches graffiti-tagged in silver

work done
my shadow reaches
the sunlit laurels

faltering resolutions the roof gutters still full of last year's leaves

the window cleaner's ladder
leaves two small holes
in the planet

April -
a gull's cry passing
through morning snow

rattling white in my eye socket a half moon and two aspirin 

Oh, a cold rain
again fills the river
with circles

Moss on the roof
tiles. First one cat
then another

i go to bed you stay downstairs
the windscreens ice over

year's end
there's a hearse
in the fast lane

geminids a couple
of white pills before
i go to bed

double whisky
everything glistens
in the mist

overcast
until a white moth lands
on my phone screen

wind chime
a text brings news
of his death

frost burn
high windows blaze
with sunlight

spring evening
a long pause on the bridge
to watch the water run

glistening frost
the slow blue arc
of a buzzard

roadkill pheasant
all the blustery colours
of autumn

in the hedge
the lighted windows
of a train

in dark river water, shapes of things from the human world

somewhere beyond our chilli pepper plant the red dragonfly's home

even after 30 years
the scent of honeysuckle
one summer night

into the space between thoughts falling rose petals

monday morning
ant traffic on the main stem
of the rose

full moon
a pear hanging
this side of the wall

starless night
the cyclist
without lights

sunny afternoon
the scent of leaf mold
mixed in the ice

hawk, on a fence post.
first light,
the rain a kind of mist.

day moon
the jellyfish we spot
from the end of the pier

muggy night opening another window to let in more insects

sunglassesheadphones  the world beyond

a blue-black feather glistens with rain another unexplained bruise

high summer
where the shade stops
so does the dog

grey skies our late neighbour's pink roses reach over the fence

not long till sundown
into the willows
a yellow frisb e e 

sunlight in the snail trails my glittering career

another cloudy night
i google
the moon phase

water changing
into ice 
the pale moon

sunless days
the world locked in
a pine cone

easter sunset
a red-tinged cross
of contrails

neatly stacked
the scents
of sawn timber

plum blossom
the haiku poet's mind...
elsewhere

spring sunshine
on a high branch a plastic bag
puffs out its chest

in the grey of relentless rain 
his shaved cranium and huge red headphones

on the brickwork graffiti, and marks that say ivy was here

new moon i hear about it first via twitter

red tulips in the vase on TV another cosy murder show

winter solstice
inside the hollow tree
fire blackened

Zen garden
after each storm
a clean slate

hazy afternoon
the woodpecker's call
bounces off the ice

her skin flickers in television light rain on the window

the proper word for brackets escapes me crescent moon

a cut glass bowl
holds the shells of our summers
this life in exile

hard frost -
deep in my coat pocket
summer sea-glass

that same music
again and again
winter rain

the graveyard
our icy shortcut
through the winter fog

icebleak
no colour but the rail bridge
graffiti

still life -
at the lake's edge a tree's reflection
caught in the ice

november sun -
leaning on the old stone wall
a shadow tree

winter solstice
the pink tongue of a cat
lapping at snowmelt

dusky clouds 
a patch of blue
hangs over the valley

demi-lune
la glace craque
sous les pas

war memorial
snow has almost covered
the poppy wreaths

antique store window
looking at dirty street snow
through colored bottles

cold attic -
faded cigar box
filled with seashells

windless day
the prolific weeds
at the grave site

mushiatsui asa
te ga kimi o
omoidashi

taifuu ya
sugi tatta ba ni
hikari ari

ame no yoru

egret stands
in the blue rice field,
dusk creeps in

long centipede
on the ceiling- long talks
of what to do

February 
the heart-shaped tracks
of a moose

white clouds drift
in the August sky,
a child dreams

tan lines
and coconut oil
high tide

restless night
the morning starts
without me

familiar names-
the warmth of a woodstove
in January

fine shell new moon
onto cherry pink horizon...
shades of easter egg

A lull in the storm 
the woodpecker darts
to another tree.

The thyme
has gone to seed 
summer's end.

things come and go 
raindrops
on the pine

my stone Buddha
sits in the dark 
snow, snow, snow

cherry petals
flying higher and higher -
storm in my valley

returning birds 
three notes pass through
morning fog

a cup of tea
and a koan to go -
my cold morning

severe frost -
the sparkling whiteness
of my brown roof

autumn deepens -
I wonder what my neighbour
is writing today?!

voices of autumn -
the patter of raindrops
on my rooftiles

first cicada -
the hot day seems
even hotter

red poppy dolls
sit alone by the beach -
dead children of Tohoku 

politicians play
the same old games -
long rainy season

late spring -
the old kettle
still shines

earthquake night -
the stars are as silent
as ever

table 4 2
- a romance reduced
to numbers

scent of rain
all the ways
we failed each other

cold sunshine -
the icicles refuse
to melt

cold night -
the deeper levels of dreams
and fears

when celsius
and farenheit meet -
cold night

New Year's morning -
I wipe some dirt
from my glasses

blizzard -
the heavy weight
of snowflakes

menopause -
she even quarrels with
the autumn moon

fighting
the summer heat -
no time for poetry

the future
deep in the tea leaves...
spring growth

first firefly -
the moon also shows
his face

spring rain
the dogwood
half petals, half leaves

wisteria blossoms...
the faint memories
of grandmother's lace 

daybreak - - 
light and shadow 
on the apricot blossoms

how black!
dirt on the last patch
of snow

rainy day -
I finally finished
the Spring Saijiki

computer crash...
I wish I were
this butterfly

my daily bread
on the empty table...
spring equinox

old plum tree in bossom...
last year the old owner
died

moonlight
on the temple roof -
and silence

autumn equinox -
all the crows celebrating
with grave offerings

the dance of
echoes inside a crypt...
winter chill

hunger moon
how bittersweet
this longing

dinner outside...
the crumbs walk along
the brick wall

a tiny world
unfolds and thrives -
summer rain

the backyard
of a poor man's home...
summer heat

more rain -
lavender leans
on the stone Buddha

no fireflies...
moonlight reflects
on camellia leaves

first firefly...
a quiet night and then
lightning

powlonia blossoms -
a haiku floating
in the sky

a centipede
takes its morning walk...
aah, my kitchen table

winter,s end...
my warm socks
with big holes

spring sunshine
on the cat's belly...
mountain hermitage

a fallen leaf
brushes the corner
of your grave stone

late snow ..
a pheasant calls
in the morning mist

Ides of March...
anyone remembers
the history teacher?

spring blossoms...
the old farmer
coughs blood

winter sunset -
half of my Buddha
still in the light

remembering you -
the sparkle of the last
icicle

first sunrise -
a fallen camellia
shines on my path

winter sunshine -
the slow growth of a stone's
shadow

autumn equinox...
the murmur of waves
slowly changes

high autumn sky...
in the world of men
voices of insects

autumn deepens...
these tiny pink flowers
on my wildest weeds

autumn chill
the fallen leaf's veins
tinged a deeper hue

in the shade
of the full moon...
distant fireworks

summer heat...
the cats sleep
on the barbeque

looking for fireflies...
I almost miss
the dramatic night sky

meditating
on a rainy day...
new green tea

morning prayers -
the graves of the ancestors
in deep silence

day moon 
the clock has stopped
ticking

autumn evening -
the lingering warmth
of this old deck chair

autumn colors 
I remember mother's
favorite quilt

summer's end -
my cat still high
on the hot tin roof

autumn with alzheimer -
she breaks the bread
..... .. carefully

another day
the stilled heartbeat
on the ultrasound

globalization -
he serves the sushi fish
on french bread

lightning
far away in the sky -
first firefly

summer in the temple -
the horns of the dragon
just visible

may rain 
ever more sparkling
shades of green

Confucius 
another long path
to the old pond

late spring -
the old kettle
still shines

war in Iraq -
a spider hides
in the cherry blossom

blue mountains -
the old tombstone
keeps watch

kyoofuu ni daite o-kure-yo ume shiroshi

spring storm -
the tall pine leans
toward the short

cheap motel
the desk clerk
turns a blind eye

day lilies
the dormant spark of death
within me

rosebuds in snow -
the softness of his hand
on my shoulder

hitokoto mo iwanu warera ya tera no aki

spring storm 
the wind rings our
visitor's bell

mandarin ducks -
a silent pair on
the dinner table

the stone memorial of the
God of Water

winter morning 
a few dewdrops on
my last rose

winter sunshine -
the many shadows of
a small camellia

wedding anniversary  
does he still love me
like the red winter berries?

cold winter day -
hot tea from Kenya
in my cup

vernal equinox
my days and nights now measured
not in hours
but by our time together
and apart

mountain temple -
a prayer overgrown
with moss

autumn deepens  
a last sunray
on the pines

misty morning -
a black and white world
behind the graves

doing the dishes -
a tiny soap bubble rises
toward heaven

summer sunset 
your hand heavy
on my knee

kyoo mo mata
ochiba ni yuki no
yamagurashi

snow on red leaves 
so many coincidences
in my life

the dragon 
now a cloud
in my sky

listening
to an incense stick 
autumn draws deeper

autumn deepens 
memories fade into
misty clouds

despite
the foreclosure sign
daffodills

autumn deepens 
the crows chatter muffled
by thick fog

just staring
at some autumn clouds 
a hot cup of tea

mata hitotsu
kabe ni ana ari
ten takashi

miya suzushi
baba wa kami o
katari-ori

lunchtime 
a dead cicada
surrounded by ants

enlightenment stones
in the temple garden
summer heat

fragrant daphne 
the money collector stops
before he knocks

hailstorm 
under the groaning roof
I hold my breath

white roads
leading nowhere 
Happy New Year?

an old temple
amongst cedar trees
too many leaves fallen...

freezing rain
the words
I cannot take back

forgetting my words
step by step
the autumn night deepens

a mosquito
aiming noisily 
the sound of one hand

ooame ya
tobimawaru wa
shiroki cho

watching summer clouds
thoughts shaping and
reshaping

kiri saite
suterare mura ni
haka nokoru

haru no ame
mukashi mukashi no
monogatari

after the postman 
nothing in the mailbox
except a lizard

November afternoon
the insistent bell
of an ice cream vendor

breakfast alone
I find the dove's feather
he left for me

late frost
warmth of the tea mug
against my cheek

deep winter
igniting the match
with a lit candle

library return
her hand's warmth
lingers in the book

cloudless sky
the gleam of fresh lemons
in a blue bowl

from a mirror
pale blue eyes stare knowingly
the snow will deepen

prairie roads
in ditches full of snowmelt
moons float

old house,
all doors
are open

a kitten...
will it too forget
its first snow?

full moon night...
starting the camp fire
with a page of fashion magazine

a new cellphone...
so many people to talk to
till the battery dies

out of the city,
so many stars
unnamed

late summer rain 
two kids break the bottles
under the bridge

cold rain
the persistent warmth
of your kiss

acorn falls
the sound of rain
continues

the moon
in every puddle
the same

Falling leaves
I already miss you
This winter

raking the leaves 
wind blows
the wrong way

hot beach sand...
between my fingers
a cigarette butt

between the second
and the third line -
short trip to bathroom

stupid arab -
he only wants to learn
to fly straight

dentist's office -
cracks between tiles
filled with dirt

after a cold night
a cup of coffee -

dressed as Santa

at the table

hedgehog in the fog
looking for apples
under the wrong tree

van gogh's blue irises
hangs on a wall, with
other gardens

storm clouds -
mother searches for
candles

lavender blooms
next to the violets
in a blue pot

Purple nights
fold into morning
whiteouts,
your silence frosts
my first cup of coffee.

through closed eyelids
lightning strikes
my dream

stars
a full pool
in the garden

drenched
in the old grounds
we cuddly

fresh sawdust
among the birches 
his bent shoulders

discarding
the tea leaves
distant thunder

autumn wind
knowing what you
will say next

scent of roses 
counting the stars
one by one

thunderstorm 
a shadow pauses
at the gate

starry night...
counting out my pills
for chemo

from morning to night -
his caddy in his house

under the moon

on the night of the pond

for a second cup

the sky and I
silent exchange
thoughts and stars

to wait

on the wall

cuts through the silence

submerged by waste
glory in decay

It makes the darkest darkness

clipped on the wall
by a brush

found water

suddenly

narrow to each other
autumn wind

time passes
the graves in the cemetery
you are old

mown field
long lines of stems
nameless

stone staircase
on the steps footprints
of men and Rain

amid the myrtle
carved in granite
door to nowhere

the wind carries
scent of mimosa
between the antennas

from year to year
grow old with the trunk
heart engraved

a man was hanged.

Rats, of course

ebb tide's retreat
and I grow older
recessionals

tang of salt spray
at a fishing pier

lighting the way
with a jar of fireflies
last summer's childhood

in the evening coolness
of a verandah
Reflect hereyes stars

after-night long
the singing of birds
at dawn

wisp of clouds
the slow spiral of debt
in my espresso

Gazing at the moon
it was still summer's evening
feast for mosquitoes

clouds gather
in a darkening sky
a walk interrupted

a careful sip
of chickpea more than coffee
His breakfast brew

croaking of frogs
just after-dawn
summer memories

silk from a web
entangled in my hair
a homeless spider

before dawn
By the small pond
The sound of crickets

chamomile petals
swimming in rainwater
for her blond highlights

Splat!
a windshield and a bug
find Each Other

polished granite
Reflects my face off
my father's grave

cold rain
sharp as nails
late afternoon

Almost dusk -
the zigzag flight
of linked dragonflies

El Hueso's dry bones
still wrapped in a uniform
That he so disgraced.

old, brittle, dry bones
found inside a uniform
a past imperfect

childhood's summer gift
That first dandelion
dancing on the wind

My tea gets colder
and the madeleine just sinks
memory Betrays

a cooing is Heard
from a small puff of feathers
Reviews another dawn

small green waves crashing
contre has porcelain rim
morning tea tempest

in an old snapshot
His Irish smile still flashes
her slight, shy smile, too

faces from the past
Their memories in old pictures
effaced by the flood

red poppies growing
entre rows of white tombstones
as in remembrance

under a full moon
a homeless man gathers cans
urban harvest

waiting
for my illness to end
November rain
seeps slowly, slowly
into the ground

deep into the night
a dog's sharp bark
Becomes gunfire

butterfly wings
Their so loud flapping
in a temple's Silence

sharp smell
after-noon downpour has
electric summer

rows of white markers
all at Attention
Memorial Day

late morning breakfast
left uneaten
too much of spring

Just a small basketball
filled with hidden treasures
she proudly caries

a yellowed clipping
falls out from her Bible
Emmett Till's obit

In front of bronze doors
They huddle Against the Cold
the newly homeless

early morning dew
was bronze temple bell
just before ringing

clear lake enclosed
Entirely Within
a bowl of miso

my body
aching and feverish
after-nightfall
the autumn wind rises

breakfast still rumbles
but no guns are --other Heard
Armistice morning.

he winds up His watch
n Carefully That morning
That will end the war

The bugler plays "Tap"
her face so serious
her parents, so proud

Ordinary morning
bluest of skies, crisp, clear air
up to the shadows

Mid morning coffee
sipped from a chipped mug old
so comforting

Rainbows reflected
in So Many potholes
afternoon rainstorm

That spring day
the flowers-have long faded
yet we remember

Reflects the mirror
a face I know so well
dad's

a flagpole stands guard
before has flooded schoolhouse
as a river runs

perched on a guardrail
of a busy highway
year egret preens

three days
of cold autumn rain
a dull ache
settles deep
inside my breasts

Cracks on a sidewalk
Lost Among the grass and weeds
urban spring

Cracked head statue
of the Buddha a reminder
everything passes.

one plus one = 3
a happy couple expecting
Their first child

Fountain pen ink spill
not contained by a blotter
Mare Crisium

she cries silently
her sobs barely audible
and no one to hear

rivulets of red
running down her pale young face
she clutches a doll

he turns one last time
His sailor's flashing wry smile
That bright November.

the War on Horror
G.I.'s on hashish kill
Afghans for sports

I turn off the pumpkin lights
a predawn
harvest moon

white roadside crosses
Where the road meets Nature's swale
memento mori

Sentinels of spring...
kites bobbing for care
saucy winds in March

Gleaners harvest moon
pale faces, leaden eyes stare
at an empty field

glassy-eyed, gutted
catch of the day we shaved ice
at the fish market

Neither white nor black
a yellow smog That will not lift
Alzheimer's pall

Full Corn Moon
time to gather the harvest
before leaves fall

charred goat bones
They say without conviction
Somali nightmares

too hot for miso!
he pushes it aside
That August morning

wildflower bouquet
we left country highway
the endless road

Carefully tea leaves
saved, dried, and used again
hidden poverty

there's a pelican
 en ce que ball of feathers, tar
or it is a gull?

beneath the fireworks
endless bullfrogs

the crowd
holding blossoms...
thunder!

Among new lilies
she waters the stone
Buddha

white clouds
glide Safely
over mine fields

homesick-
sundown just behind
the fence

spitting seeds
into a blue Sky-
the old elm

Forgetting to ask
for the seniors' rate-
falling leaves

just over the fence
a constellation of stars
trucks and

wildflowers
along my neighbor's wall
soften her voice

unexpected guest-
a thought out cam
of nowhere

smell of rain
young deer run
Across the field

winter rain
Where the sheets she slept
grow colder

sifting shadows
with remnants
of rain

desert sand...
my sleeping bag under
a full moon

giant moon...
the bark of a dog echoes
over the fence

crystalline sky
the pioneers left no clue
qui trail to take

willow scent
hangs a kingfisher
in the air

desert heat-
smilies along the narrow road
to the deep north

spring trek
a rusted snowplow
at roads' end

sweet basil
dried snail tracks crisscross
the window box

Arizona
road rest stop, the dog sniffs
yellow snow

a moth flutters
over the candle flame...
damned fool

still water...
the undercurrent
in her voice

storm warning...
a street corner argument
Many turns heads

falling stars
from the sky...
autumn moon

November winds
the dog finds dead birds
in the hedge

desert cemetery-
my sister in law
Does not weep

summer ends-
her pale freckles
in dark tan

highway fog-
the honking of geese
homeward bound

desert wind-
iron and copper flavor
in my coffee

spring day-
the wall clock
still winter

appalachian spring-
carbide carbuncles
in the coal oil light

moon hare-
bloody gloves lay
on the ice

frosty dawn-
the dog watches me
pack my bag

campfire coffee...
condor wings glean
the first rays of sun

making pancakes
between whispers...
morning mist

arctic air
soothes the desert heat...
blended whiskey

slate skys
chalk mark outlines
on the sidewalk

peach moon...
the thin slice left
for us

grassy moon
we slip off our shoes
to count the stars

garden embrace
the fresh smell of her
sun dried laundry

kitchen embrace
the smell of her hot
apple pie

farewell embrace
a faint essence
of mothballs

montana morning
the horses with their backs
to blowing snow

street light sway 
dreams of her linger
with the storm

Sack of cheeries 
clouds grow dark on the road
to the coast

humid morning...
words dangle
from her lips

salmon sunrise
a splash resounds over
the calm bay

farmer's market
she paints a flower
on a child's cheek

tandem bicycle
wind in our hair
a shared laugh

misty morning
echoes of blue jay cries
through the pines

fresh brewed coffee
cream and sugar swirls
she stirs in her thoughts

spring breeze
blowing dandelions
in circles

dry haystack
flames climb higher
against the night sky

rainy morning
the haijin stirs
sugar in his coffee

alabaster moon 
glowing among bare pine tops
in cool mountain mist

kissing her slowly
where the rain
never falls

humid night...
the darkness
between your thighs

Passover darkness -
before the buds burst open
a child's eyes in death.

desert garden
frosted lettuce leaves
in the pink dawn

old park bench
i touch our initials
each time i pass

new housing
hammer and saw replace
the dove's coo

christmas services
a cellular phone rings out
handel's messiah

no island
in the bay today
morning fog

stop sign
thru the bullet holes
ghetto moon

November fog
not a tree
to be seen.

Purple loosestrife
pale in the
lingering mist.

A cold morning
the pink of tulips
through the mist.

upstairs, swathed
in neon, the
scent of jasmine

a movement of deer
into twilight
suddenly spring

fireflies competing
with a full moon
summer solstice

the way grass parts
as the pheasant passes
spring's end

moonlessness
so many ways
I want to touch you

earth day
even the shadows at dusk
smell green

fading
right before my eyes
morning moon

light rain
on sweet, sweet clover
late summer's dusk

winter rain
the confusion in her voice
all over again

This morning the geese
have taken over the skies
in wild abandon
how sudden this stillness then
and now how I have missed you

morning moon
filling up my window
autumn's end

lanternless night...
a whisper passing
through leaves

autumn twilight
captures the mood of leaves
swirling everywhere
in this circular motion
hear the laughter of children

white cloud of a moon
drifting in the morning sky
these October days
how like a fine mist that fades
this future now so fragile

summer's end
the tenderness
of light

after loving-making
scent of wild clover
through the window

my children and I
race to see the sunset
before it fades

how tenuous time now seems
slipping away
from my reach

after the dream
the scent of approaching rain
in the dusty air

blackbird song -
the name of a daughter
i'll never know

funeral -
stuck in an antique vase
bubble

autumn rains
on the way to the old house
new banks

file -
between my car stereo
two transmitters

a slower
moon this evening...
the cold!

the last leaf -
his white breath dissolves
in the garden

Indian summer
takes the wheel
counter clockwise

summer afternoon
the boy to school window
reads the clouds

whirling
on the trampoline
cherry blossoms

kite shop -
entering with every customer
the summer breeze

spring rain
paint is peeling
the garden gnome

falling leaf -
fills the fading light
slow my room

first date
close to each other
to study the menu

sunrise
from village to village
cockcrowing

dental practice
in the waiting room a row
yellowed chairs

autumn depths...
a mole dreaming
of darkness

memories
the carbon black
on the roof tiles

museum hall
studying children
their echoes

early frost
the cold side
of the bed

December Rain...
person view
on a wall

reflection in the window
his weeping face -
thud of rain

at the end of the day
the shade of the oak cross
the village street

Asked about Le Monde
glasses upside -
how tired!

Thanksgiving Day
delicate aroma of turkey -
sky scorched from Iraq

out of the metro
face to face with the moon -
return from work

full moon
above the skyscrapers -
it's midnight

the egg seller...
her cracked hands
speak of winter

to November
trumpets of death -
five or six

Day of Thanksgiving -
bountiful harvest
bought cheaply

the rising sun -
in frosted glass
a star cluster

70 mph
the infant snores
a bit Slower

winter night
finding my pajama bottoms
on my wife

putting a cork
In last night's wine
late autumn

the glass jar
full of fireflies
bedtime

evening sky
Some counting fireflies
more than once

smell of rain -
soft ridges of mint leaves
oil my fingers

remembering summer
how brittle the leaves
underfoot

high noon...
young girls harvest
rice from a mirror

summer rain
the smell of earth
in the air

watching clouds
the white petals
of a crushed crocus

smells of spring
adrift in the morning air
bubbles under ice

after the rain
moon and stars
underfoot

my wife
home from hospital
hibiscus in full bloom

My 72nd winter
the deepening cold
in every room 

month-old obit
of an ex-girl friend
unexpected rain

back and forth
across our conversation
fireflies

death watch ended
the rain storm
begins

my wife
home from the hospital
hibiscus in full bloom

spring
a few blocks closer
than yesterday

after the storm,
an egret fording
darkness

at opposite ends
of the reading room
ex-lovers

despite my assurances
my wife's makeup
thicker

somewhere
behind the old barn
end of the rainbow

despite the day's heat
mum's tombstone
so cold

thunderstorms
all day long
broken promises

hot chocolate
the scent stronger
this cold night

late night rain
the crickets finally
silent

nothing
in our bedroom
but moonlight 

sunset traffic
slowly down the hill
into darkness

at the crossroads
no wind to give
a direction

early spring...
young women collecting
peach blossoms

smalltown street
sunset and moonrise
at opposite ends

slow afternoon
the rain changes
to drizzle

home alone
the cold
of an autumn rain 

silent night
the fog thick
at every window

late night traffic
the swirl of leaves after
the last bus

deep deep deep cold
the lengthening pauses between
her words

while making love
the last icicle
falls

bad news from home
the cold morning
colder still

voices
in the cemetery
remembrance day

slow afternoon
the rain changes
to drizzle

after midnight...
a shooting star beneath
the wharf

after the argument
the storm clouds also
break up

pouring rain
yet another question
without an answer

graveside sermon ended
the last leaves blown from
a nearby tree

63 today
nothing from here to the horizon
but fair weather clouds

start of a new season
a book loaned
to a new friend

summer solstice    the wind still cold

right after
morning prayers
distant thunder

mountain storm
somewhere during its echo
the thunder ends

60 today
the full moon
still rising

somewhere
in the graveyard
birdsong

mid-summer...
she shares with me
a ripe melon!

also
in the fog
the scent of autumn

cold dark night
the warmth of her hand
in mine

snow and rain mixed
my angry words
and her tears

death
of an old friend
my cup empty

pelting rain
on the car radio
nothing but blues

behind the man
in the open doorway
nothing but darkness

the gap
between the mountains
filled with fog

spring breeze
between pages of an old book
a crushed rose

bedtime 
trying not to count
maimed solders

indian summer
the viagra stock
deflates

no longer a
mirror, this lake chasing
geese into darkness

late season
christmas lights illuminate
a golden buddha

Fly,
be afraid!
No Buddhists in this house!

after the fireworks... the thunder moon

huddled cows
their steam thickens
the valley mist 

for a moment
the gull in the air
is very white

leap year
looking a her twins
a squinting woman 

less cars
in front of the brothels
valentine's day 

on my smartphone
mount fuji in the sunset
morning coffee 

after the bell
just the rain on the umbrellas
ashes to ashes 

for just a moment
the warmth of our tears
cold rain

almost summer...
eating an especially
ripe mango

the evasive look
of a teen without make up
first buds

her cooled tea
in the middle of the table
first snow 

evening tram
her diamond on her nose
a star 

more piercing
in the autumn mist
the blackbird's song

asleep
a golden dot on her ear
bus forty one

emptied fountain
carried by the autumn wind
silt scent

March morning
look eastward
fukushima

cold sun
in the parliament
their screams

the silence
of the rain april
partner after the shower

Winter storm
a drop through the window
Drop by drop

Gusts of wind
dancing together under
a harvest moon

autumn sun
the footsteps of my father
slower

a darkest point
in the snow ultrasound
full autumn moon

full moon
after the pumpkin soup
more rounded belly

in the fog
My breath is lost
the evening train

on the bridge
people hurry
summer rain

snowfall
the tea bag sinks
slowly in water

in my palm
her bigger breasts
winter sun

December evening
on the ultrasound screen
as snow

twilight winter
the shadow of the scarecrow
beyond the scope

slowly
advance beetle
June storm

the fullness
of ripe melons...
this summer moon

full moon
the shadow of her breasts
lands on me

Back to School
still a bit high tide
near dunes

early March
on the dog's carcass
the first flies

low tide -
quartered in the fort
the corpse of a dog

sunset
on the fourth glass
the trace of a bird

under cassiopée
a cricket

Around the Moon
Slowly, the fog
above crickets

watch the moon
move behind the oak
Summer Wind

calm water
two swans frolic
calm water

Autumn freshness
to feed a child
eighty years

summer leaves...
remembering
mother's dry skin

Saturday morning
under the cherry tree from Japan
a pink puddle

the Great Bear
moving on water
spring rain

spring evening
because we quietly
near violets

blue night
violets
invisible

ex-girlfriend
with a baby carriage
spring rain

tonight
disrupts a moorhen
the Great Bear

first snow
a clueless teenager
died from an overdose

new Moon
nothing on the lake
the cry of the moorhen

low clouds
listen snow
sleepless night

scents of apple pie
my grandmother's kitchen
photo album

a mountain,
the stone buddha...
and cold food

haiku
written on the subway
illegible

Friday night
the office of silence
on my keyboard

partner after the fireworks
he marvels
at the moon

five am
behind the thick fog
the smell of fresh bread

in the mirror
the look of love of mother
for his daughter who recites

in the empty schoolyard
only plastic bags
are going the rounds

on the neck
the scent of her hands
drink greedily

a pen in hand
it has its drain
and I its strengths

like last year
cherry blossoms
hides buildings

open the window
and smell the white lilac
hatched tonight

first day of spring
stubborn icicles
still hang on

daybreak
your kiss on the lip
of a coffee cup

ripples in the sand
and then round in water
low tide and then high

fresh autumn breeze
or the advance of age?
forgotten tea...

moonless night
a cereus cactus opens
blooms solstice

sudden gust
carp leap from pole
to gulp the air

wind chill
beneath the monk's robe
a naked monk

screen of pine
white silent glides
we egret wings

sand through fingers
a tracery of palms
midnight blue one

silken winds
i am wrapped in quietness
of cottonwood seeds

back and forth
slowly grinding ink
the weight of my words

spring nightfall
ink melts
stone over

the full moon
and a rice field
planted with stars

fogged window
a blend of green and gray -
hot tea with milk

morning fog
dissolving cypress -
sfumato

slice of moon
the scent of jasmine spills
into thick darkness

brilliant Venus drips
from a gold crescent moon
this night as the first
the eve of thirty years
veiled in ultramarine

the rain
in the yellow landscape
September

Lobster top
with his eyes shaped buttons
fixed me

August
all singers insects
day and night

a bit of wind
on my bare shoulders
smell of morning

summer morning
even green barley field
surrounds the ruined abbey

flowers
cut early
on the pavement

moon day...
a paper lantern floating
down river

tall grass
curved with the nozzle flange
midday

vow of obedience
high curved herbs
in the harmattan

sap
flowing maple flank
frost cracks

red leaves
the first to fall
porto tonight

Zen garden
steles emerge from the sand
another dead soldier

tra i lampi
it suono della cavalletta
ancora un poco

full moon -
missing two evenings
to its roundness

her hair done
sheltered from the north wind
open grave

it prolongs
blower computer
the cricket

wait for morning
the sun at the end of the branches
Maple

kissing you
under a paper moon...
the stars!

children are
float colored lanterns
evening Hiroshima

changing winds
bring up your kite
and the Dow

summer solstice
the longest days
shorter written

spring wind
scattered the flowers of magnolia
nineteen years

in the antique shop
the bottom of the empty cabinet
the rays of the sun

bow our heads
passing under the lilac
heavy snow

the last note
before she boards the bus
cold winter morning

pass
between the shade of the maple
and the moon

nightfall
follow the war on screen
sleep without dream

last moon
before irradiation
Hiroshima

cool morning...
your smile pasted on
a coffee cup

pissing in a puddle
Droplets of moonlight
On Her sandal

indian summer
the neighbor's daughter sunbathes
Their beside empty pool

chill night
New fallen pear blossoms
glow in the moonlight

fresh cut lawn
a dozen fireflies
inspect the job

windstorm
the berry stains
on the path

amid war
and rumors of war...
Reviews another grandchild

spring cleaning
long neglected baseball cards
see the light of day

long night
the waterfall's
icy silence,

gale winds
the stone Buddha
remains centered

beautiful orange butterfly
On His shoulder lands
oblivious

a monkey Listens
a son own breath...
autumn rain

trembling
the hair ribbon falls
with inhibitions

jury duty
the clock pendulum goes
back and forth

summer breeze
someone practices drums
in the valley

no rain
the sound of crunched
grass

museum
so hot the mummy
hoodies

drops down the lily
leaf by leaf

hail storm
the golfers run
for cover

of every tree

of gentle raining
cloudlight 

lull
reading into the braille 
of your goose bumps

tighter on my glove

opening the saijiki
to early spring

faintly purple
Against the moon -
pines in the light

the last light of day
purple rhododendrons
dissolves in the dark

full moon
only you at my window
an empty face
DID loneliness wipe away
the last traces of passion?

irises
bluer
hers in

petals pressed
entre pages of a book
i never read

on glass

so clear

winter solstice
passing her
bends the candle's flame

bamboo depths...
in carp circles
your smile

Cup of tea
It is finally empty
smoke of incense

mist on the fields
just is glimpsed
the loose crumbling

it breaks the silence
the negra lullaby
there over the pier

after the rain
en laundry Waving
in the blue sky

under the rain
on the last step
you turned

Loaf of bread
in a puddle
bum has fishing

Night Flight
on the wings of aircraft
Moon strips

sunny day
finally on the pine
a cicada

sky clouds
only aircraft
Blows engine

empty street
through the cat
tail wind

short night...
thoughts of you and
a paper thin moon

sound of footsteps
football has to a can
Silence and then

King in armor
a mantle of snow
on his shoulders

Ghetto in the morning
lined up, cold,
against the wall

in the twilight
burn the moths
lamp

like every night
the voices in the street
lilac flower

three petals fall
from the purple coneflower...
Almost Summer

the chimneys

Deep autumn
The apple colder
In the tree.

visiting the graves

at my grandparents'

over the hedge

floating in a leftover
cup of tea

from summer rain just you...
and the scent
of melon

remembering
her small breasts

an egret standing
knee deep in mud

lakeside
the fog makes the loon's call
much more haunting

twilight
watching my shadow
float downriver

sipping more than
just tea
the moon in passing

eyeing
the apple
at buddha's feet

the farmer,
planting corn under
a pregnant moon

drunk tonight
an elixir of cherry blossoms
and moonlight

memories
floating in a tea cup
autumn moon

his shadow
passes me by
the charcoal seller

the potter's fingers
wet with clay
first rain

saying the rosary
a laborer
planting rice

rainy night
her phone number
in my wallet

river road
he stops to buy
a can of worms

cold night
the clink of bottles
in a grocery cart

contemplating
nightfall
the stone buddha

the offering
in front of the stone buddha
eaten by cats

between two rivers,
the echo of
his mallet

sunday afternoon
a steam train
pushes back the fog

eating rice
how many stars are
in the sky?

falling leaves
a trail of clothing
leads to the bed

biting his nails,
a little boy watches
the outgoing tide

cold night
my reflection
sipping coffee

moon viewing
just me and spider
tonight

the moose grunts.again.
the nylon tent walls
seem thinner

moon viewing
warming my hands
with a cup of coffee

stars paint the
cemetery ground

all saints day
spent candles
in the cemetery

with charcoal

at dawn

sweeping the temple
zealously

house cleaning
the forest fire
at dawn

metal birds
fly south to the
forest fire

she rants about her boss
all through supper

even my pee
stays inside this
cold winter night

snowfall
a milk mustache
on my daughter's face

geese honking
children in the
bathtub playing

lakeside,
below the egret
a city of lights

thousands of miles
away, her first birthday
fresh mango

swimming across
the moonlit sky
a gray carp

half moon
darkness drinking from an
alabaster teacup

floating
down river
an egret's shadow

dried wheat grass
a bleached blond
combing her hair

no stars
in the sky tonight
hungry carp

first frost warning -
she no longer
pours his coffee

burning leaves
this foggy evening
two kinds of smoke

waiting for winter
eating rice balls
under a full moon

scooping steamed rice,
the laborer
at sundown

windswept afternoon
tea scent
on my tongue

thank you, mango
for a moment i was
somewhere else

passing cars
replace sheep
this sleepless night

reoccurrence
of cancer 
no spring this year

gentle
on my window
summer rain
and his whispers rising
falling, rising...

in memory of Quentin Crisp:

season of mists...
a calling of wild geese
arrows south

afternoon card parties
the rumor mill's
farm system 

amber leaves
caught between 'for sale'
and 'sold'

again and again -
news of his wife's death

old manor house
each empty room has
its own echo

slender grasses
and warm summer rain
touching the buddha

into dusk
the white rose
still whiter

carousel music
the little girl's smile
comes round again

winter ennui... 
coming down with a slight 
touch of clouds 

a ladder leans
into the scent of apples...
orchard fog

brewing storm...
how the clouds stir
in my coffee 

skin mapping
the familiar constellations
on his back

recycling
old stories get a new twist
at the rumor mill

only the glow
of a paper lantern
new moon

alighting
on the edge of night
barn owl

brussel sprouts
only the bitterness left
on our table

brewing storm...
how the clouds stir
in my coffee

a touch 
of bluegrass...
spring 

the noir
of a beetle's carapace
passing rain

bobble and bounce
of the last marshmallow...
hot cocoa 

cutting flowers...
a honeybee lingers
in the empty space

the first scent 
of pink jasmine
open book

wet wooly mittens
drying by the hearth side
the smell of wet sheep

city hall scandal
the town's rumor mill
adds a third shift

the rhythmic lift
of her childbearing hips
high tide 

another way out...
a backdoor slammin'
in the wind 

Beware of Dog
only the wildest flowers
go in there

the visual feast
of the first plum blossom
hunger moon

left behind
his scent of aftershave
on my cheek 

wolf call
in the distance...
ice moon

the hollow sound
of sacred earth landing
six feet below

mud-spattered pickup-
four dogs watch
the tavern door

spring fever
my heartbeat quickens
through the avalanche zone

spring morning-
the urge to skip
and the wisdom not to

mid April
even in the shadows
the ice melts

power outage
hoarfrosted pines
shimmer in moonlight

red sky-
our boat flag frayed
by 20 summers

rumble of thunder-
slicing just-picked peaches
for the pie

spring fever
my pockets full
of old grocery lists

spring rain
I read his letters
one last time

the familiar wail
of a common loon-
your empty chair

Thanksgiving evening
the call of wild ducks
out on the bay

drumming rain
a patchwork of dreams
just before waking

the trail narrows-
every shadow
a possible bear

lingering grief-
calls of southbound geese
through misty rain

that cricket -
it's THERE
or THERE! 

avalanche warnings -
more tails of rain
and radiation 

lingering light
through the willows
scent of rain

obsidian night
the white sound
of rain

a steady drizzle-
all day the weight
of things unsaid

sleet ticking windows
the chemo drip
in its last hour

evening shadows
on the walls of the Alamo
graffiti

autumn chill
faint chimes
from our oldest clock

dusty knickknacks
I try to recall
the scent of burning leaves

midsummer morning
the boat's gentle tug
at the anchor 

an old woman
with a lost look in her eyes
chilled wind

woodsmoke and fog
along the river bank
three trails meet

winter returns
one stubborn maple still drips
ever.so.slowly

searcher's call
the lost child's name-
streetlamps veiled with rain

journey's end
far off in the blue distance
dark clouds

ice moon-
a berry branch
forced into bloom

avalanche warning-
how very still
this winter night

our dusty truck-
an Amish man walks barefoot
across the village green

that long-ago kiss
and still Orion strides
the winter sky

bitter cold
we don't chase the lone crow
from the sparrow's food

deepening snow
she leaves our atlas open
to her homeland

warmed-over coffee
the gray gray sound
of winter rain

3:00 a.m.
through sounds of winter rain
the mail plane landing

head cold -
running out of tissue
before noon

no wind tonight
across this reach of prairie
all those stars

sipping fresh cider
both dippers
among the far stars

cool morning
at the top of the rise
deer pass in the fog

meditation room
books of wisdom
lean left... and right

turning north
sand from both oceans
in little jars

the wind all night
rips limbs from the trees-
a long wait for dawn

nearly 60 
so many mountains around me
still unclimbed

a B-52
thunders over the bay
blue heron lifting

atop the high wall...
the intertwining of
barbed wire  roses

after brief rain...
petrol rainbows appear
on the tarmac

patience.
on the dock he sits beside
a can of worms

mist and rain-
from the dark church
we walk into light

uphill country walk...
on the verge wild plants
thriving in a carrier bag 

fading light
with its own tiny rainbow
the lake's fountain

recycling point...
one bin's slot is sealed
with a spider's web

after warm rain...
by the river the scent
of garlic  earth

after the storm...
stuck to the window
two leaves side by side

five counties, then
at the horizon
Betelgeuse

concert in full flow...
mingling with the music
the smell of cooking

washing-up done-
through netted windows
a fading sunset

the silence
between us-
filled with sunlight

early storm warning
he sends the kids
to the neighbors

falling leaves more of the sky

moon on the wane
the sound of wings
at dusk

desert dream
the sound of foghorns
on the Solent

ageing skin
the warmth and softness
of a baked apple

open windows -
all the contrails
feathering

spring clarity
the local pub reveals
its old name

poetry books
banished to the bathroom -
spring cleaning

solar flare -
spring moon half-hidden
in the clouds

February rain -
the word 'spring'
on the Scrabble board

February wind -
the word 'crocus'
on the Scrabble board

thin ice
he critiques her gravy
in front of the guest

sudden rainstorm
my place in another world
kept by a bookmark

Satie -
the rain
eases

Chinese market -
a row of small gold buddhas
share a smile

pension plans
the slow drone of a plane
coming in to land

strategic plan -
the sound of distant
foghorns

light rain -
water workers
dig a hole in the road

February sun -
a street light still on
in the daytime

the smell of varnish
lingers in the hall
like winter

Valentine's Day -
recycling
old gold

grey day
the only bright spot
a red traffic light

a hint of autumn 
that slight pause before she plucks
her first gray hair

cold rain
the greengrocer stacks cabbages
on cabbages

a window frames
the whole free world
in one white gull

between
the Prime Minister's words
birdsong

new year
fireworks
in a misty sky

late summer
graffiti overgrown
with ivy

evening sky
over fallen petals
a dark rose

a drop of ink -
tadpoles wriggle
on the water's surface

spring storm -
the grey dawn briefly
luminous

too soon the darkness
your last words lingering
in mist

moon and mist 
night settles into silence
and white breath

sweltering heat
the cicadas buzz louder
during her hot flash 

my dead mother's voice
on the answering machine
... again and again...

summer sunset
the slow glide of a heron
into shadows

young girls in fog 
the fleet movement of hands
fluffing tobacco

Chechnya 
blackened bones and ashes
smouldering

new leaves
pattered by rain...
cardinal song

new year...
a magpie turns over
an old leaf

chirping birds 
the instant I press
the stop button

Tonights light rainfall
Wraps me in soft silence
On my short walk home

examinations...
blank sheets as students
observe the falling leaves

marble moon...
the staccato of high heels
at rush hour

right turn
the clink of church keys
at the tea party

sampling my husband's
home-made wine...
autumn evening

stuck in traffic
dreaming of the monsoon
in a far-away land

at the window
the drumming of rain...
I catch up on sleep

this morning the sun
a fried egg on a plate
of blue china

doves
on the TV antenna
war on TV

winter window
closed to the cold -
purple orchid

sunflowers in bloom 
white flags
marking bodies

honeysuckle breeze
someone honks when
the light turns green

I wake beside
my daughter's sick bed
a howling dog

night of meteorites 
enjoying the sound of rain
instead

fall migration
custom combiners harvest
their way north

in winter's wind
the call of a friend
who now has cancer

harvest moon
i gather my thoughts
for winter

autumn melancholy
the click of mahjong tiles
from the computer

May clouds
new names and dates
in the family book

apricot blossoms
the birth of our first
granddaughter

blades of grass
between the flagstones...
Easter afternoon 

Monday moon
the bent backs
of rice farmers

spring morning
finding an old flame
on Facebook

spring evening
an old love letter
from my husband

summer traffic
four cars, a tractor
and the full moon

black ice
dad's last radiation
treatment 

mid February
the first garden seeds display
at the hardware store

winter night
too many stars
above Gaza

wall-to-wall clouds
and the hum of flies
summer dust

dead-end road
at the edge of the field
a new-born calf

harvest moon
the sound of women
pounding rice

winter evening
a teacup of mint
and moon

half moon
on the river the sound
of cracking ice

falling snow...
she brings his urn closer
to the window

attractive
even in red
an oak leaf

autumn mist...
what is she doing now
my mother?

September rain...
unaware of any pain
a peach falls

early sign of spring
snow shovels become
half-priced sale items

old temple
but all my prayers
are new

murmurings
in the old temple
summer wind

summer rain...
drinking tea to the cadence
of falling leaves

warm afternoon
a fly with nowhere
to go

flat moon...
an aspirine tablet and a
glass of water

the teacup
as empty as
my evening

a teacup
to fill
my afternoon

my day
measured out
in teaspoons

November moon
the last ball of cheese
in the fridge

The New Millenium
brought to my window
two new icycles

dark days of winter
the dentist explains his
payment plans

first spring snow
I release my soul in
my first yoga class

free floating
a tide full of shell fragments
and fireworks 

morning glories
find their way to the sun
on barbed wire

at half-mast
a butterfly passes by
the still flag

Origami

Those stars.
No more fish
in the bay.

apple slices-
our last words
in the knife's blade

no more war
two fighting beetles
on a tombstone

near the wall
of the cemetery
a condom

during the vigil
a withered flower
on the tiled floor

new age Luddite
he buys a dozen
paperback books 

a chill 
just before the drizzle
wind chime notes

rail track
amidst the corn fields
bisected infinity

chasing bubbles
near the floating moon
a paper boat

inching up
on the rainwashed eucalyptus
rising moon

dusty haze
at the sunrise time 
a yellow rose

daylight
in the winter haze
a faint birdsong

morning fog
my new dahlias too
look so faded 

between Lake Erie
and the nuclear station
fireflies

a dew drop 
full 
of autumn light

heavy leaves
in the evening rain
heaps of darkness

dark days of winter 
the flat screen Christmas Yule Log
burns bright in HD 

winter morning 
this egg and me
in the kitchen

persimmon tree
mallards drink in
its reflection

migratory pelicans...
the pollster presses
for an opinion

crescent moon
a young mockingbird
with its one song

fever dream
a bird chirps the refrain
from the latin mass

first frost
another wish
goes on their list

first frost
why did I never
plant evergreens?

a fat toad
leaves the garden

the coming rain 
bird calls echo 
along the creek

early spring
pallets of fertilizer
on the loading dock

dark days of winter
another mailbox loses
to the snowplow

steeping tea
no more or less
of the thin snow

first snow
a dusting of flour
in the cake pans

I walk downhill to watch
the moon rise again

spring storm
overripe bananas
in the kitchen

evening thunder
robin calls echo
across the park

the barn doors open
dry leaves sweep
into the muddy yard

no moon
the individual
songs of crickets

passing monarchs 
a few leaves flutter
to the road

cicadas
at twilight
finally it rains

summer's end
an orange sunset
crayoned on the wall

dark days of winter
at my office window
I watch the sunrise

evening walk
same flickering glow
house to house

at the foot of pants

for man

under the door

in the hundreds
dead

an earthy taste
in mouth

fancy lures
wrestling branches too

German helmets
attached

by the window -
a blue like that
our armchairs

to the source
in the rain

In the rain

Almost

applies lipstick

gray drizzle
for miles and miles
this road I'm on

one free pickle
from the barrel

christmas album
every year he wears
the same flannel shirt

murmur of rain
hard to catch the words
when he talks in his sleep

what if
the flavor of burnt toast
is in the fallen seed
my desire for bitternut
despite its name*

moonless night
a spoonful of darkness
stirring my tea

bullfrog chorus
one a little louder
than the rest

lonesome train whistle...

than the photograph

through tears

the thin gauze
of her white dress

pale legs
under a white moon
shivering aspen

in my tea

before death drained their color
and left you in that vacant room

in my black tea

- Traces of sleds rusty
in the snow yesterday

against the black trunk

in my palm

the cemetery wall

along its notes

still fills the kitchen

almost a friend
this funeral

sweeping cobwebs
from the wood pile

dusty knickknacks
mother's whole life
on one shelf

sunlit helmet
the young soldier's eyes
invisible

endless rain
without opening
a crocus falls

evening coffee—
wisps of fog rise
from the bayou

the lilac in bud—
a cloud with storm in it
swells over the bay 

partly cloudy—
I remember the face
but not the name

intertwined
in my washing machine,
my daughter's bras
and the jeans of
her latest boyfriend

false hope
a film of oil carries
bent rainbows downstream

whiskey moon—
a morning after
at the bottle’s end

a lake
brimming with mountains—
trout ripple the sky

mother-in-law's face
on the biggest pumpkin
harvest moon 

untwisting
the rose bud
spring rain

fireworks gone
Orion's beauty remains
in the stillness

solitary walk -
at nightfall the flash
of distant fireworks

stroke of midnight
the blast of foghorns
along the coast

after the rain
I check the growth
of each tulip

a lost dream
cellular phone
on the night train

Sunday morning
smells of French toast
and cinnamon...

drip.drip.drip.drip.drip.
the anticipation
of maple syrup

How thin the moon!
the scent of lilacs
grows fainter...

divorce hearing
we talk about
the rain

daybreak
the train graffiti drips
autumn dew

the slow drift...
sunbeam across
an empty room

in her eyes
the end our date
the moon

as she yells
stillness
of the ficus

in the lap
of a stone Buddha
fresh snow

divorce proceedings
our bed gets bigger
and bigger

silently day
becomes night
in this childless house

picking up his toys
still in my funeral clothes
the very last time
