 This repository contains my thesis work so far: 
 SeqGan is not mine, the original code is from https://github.com/LantaoYu/SeqGAN.
 
 My additions include the haiku and obama subfolders which are applications meant to follow
 those in the authors' paper -- which were not released on the SeqGan github.

 I have also added the files:
    module_sequence_gan.py
    dataloader_helper.py
    generated_sample.py
